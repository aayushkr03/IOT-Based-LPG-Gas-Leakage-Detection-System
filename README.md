ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
IoT-Based LPG Gas Leakage Detection & Monitoring System

ðŸ“Œ Overview:
This project is designed to enhance safety and convenience by leveraging IoT technology to detect LPG gas leaks in real-time. The system continuously monitors gas levels using an MQ2 Gas Sensor and triggers alerts when a leakage is detected. Additionally, it allows remote monitoring via a mobile app/web interface, providing real-time updates for better safety management.

ðŸ“Œ Features:
âœ… Real-Time Gas Level Monitoring â€“ Uses an MQ2 Gas Sensor to continuously track LPG concentration.
âœ… ESP32 Microcontroller â€“ Processes sensor data and connects to a cloud/server for alerts.
âœ… Remote Alerts & Notifications â€“ Sends SMS/Email/App notifications when gas levels exceed a threshold.
âœ… Mobile App/Web Dashboard â€“ View gas levels remotely and receive alerts.
âœ… Buzzer & LED Warning System â€“ Alerts nearby individuals when leakage is detected.
âœ… Automated Gas Valve Control (Optional) â€“ Can integrate with a relay module to cut off gas supply in case of leakage.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Hardware: MQ2 Gas Sensor, ESP32 Microcontroller, Buzzer, LED, WiFi Module
ðŸ”¹ Software & Cloud: Arduino IDE, Firebase/MQTT (for cloud communication), Web/Mobile App Integration
ðŸ”¹ Programming: C/C++ (ESP32), Python (for data processing), JavaScript (Web Dashboard)
